# scPhere-PyTorch

PyTorch implementation of [scPhere](https://github.com/klarman-cell-observatory/scPhere) from [Deep generative model embedding of single-cell RNA-Seq profiles on hyperspheres and hyperbolic spaces](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22851-4).

scPhere is a scalable deep generative model to embed cells into low-dimensional hyperspherical or hyperbolic spaces to accurately represent scRNA-seq data.
